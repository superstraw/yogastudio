            practice of yoga, this 60 minute class of poses and slow movement focuses

            welcome to sample this 60 minute class that focuses on breath-synchronized
            movementâ€”you will inhale and exhale as you flow energetically through yoga
            poses.

        <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
            Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at
            your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply.
            Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll
            on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with
            crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all
            that you have in life. Namaste.
